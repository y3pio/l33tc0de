# 3696. Maximum Distance Between Unequal Words in Array I

You are given a string array words.

Find the maximum distance between two distinct indices i and j such that:

words[i] != words[j], and
the distance is defined as j - i + 1.
Return the maximum distance among all such pairs. If no valid pair exists, return 0.

 
```
Example 1:

Input: words = ["leetcode","leetcode","codeforces"]

Output: 3

Explanation:

In this example, words[0] and words[2] are not equal, and they have the maximum distance 2 - 0 + 1 = 3.

Example 2:

Input: words = ["a","b","c","a","a"]

Output: 4

Explanation:

In this example words[1] and words[4] have the largest distance of 4 - 1 + 1 = 4.

Example 3:

Input: words = ["z","z","z"]

Output: 0

Explanation:

In this example all the words are equal, thus the answer is 0.

 

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 100
1 <= words[i].length <= 10
words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
