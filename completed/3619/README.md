3619. Count Islands With Total Value Divisible by K

You are given an m x n matrix grid and a positive integer k. An island is a group of positive integers (representing land) that are 4-directionally connected (horizontally or vertically).

The total value of an island is the sum of the values of all cells in the island.

Return the number of islands with a total value divisible by k.


```
Example 1:


Input: grid = [[0,2,1,0,0],[0,5,0,0,5],[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,4,7,0],[0,2,0,0,8]], k = 5

Output: 2

Explanation:

The grid contains four islands. The islands highlighted in blue have a total value that is divisible by 5, while the islands highlighted in red do not.

Example 2:


Input: grid = [[3,0,3,0], [0,3,0,3], [3,0,3,0]], k = 3

Output: 6

Explanation:

The grid contains six islands, each with a total value that is divisible by 3.



Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 1000
1 <= m * n <= 105
0 <= grid[i][j] <= 106
1 <= k <= 106
```
