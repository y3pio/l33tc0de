# 2796. Repeat String

Write code that enhances all strings such that you can call the string.replicate(x) method on any string and it will return repeated string x times.

Try to implement it without using the built-in method string.repeat.


```
Example 1:

Input: str = "hello", times = 2
Output: "hellohello"
Explanation: "hello" is repeated 2 times
Example 2:

Input: str = "code", times = 3
Output: "codecodecode"
Explanation: "code" is repeated 3 times
Example 3:

Input: str = "js", times = 1
Output: "js"
Explanation: "js" is repeated 1 time


Constraints:

1 <= times <= 105
1 <= str.length <= 1000


Follow up: Let's assume, for the sake of simplifying analysis, that concatenating strings is a constant time operation O(1). With this assumption in mind, can you write an algorithm with a runtime complexity of O(log n)?
