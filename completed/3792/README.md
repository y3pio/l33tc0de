# 3792. Sum of Increasing Product Blocks

A sequence is formed as follows:

The 1st block contains 1.
The 2nd block contains 2 * 3.
The ith block is the product of the next i consecutive integers.
Let F(n) be the sum of the first n blocks.

Return an integer denoting F(n) modulo 109 + 7.

```
Example 1:

Input: n = 3

Output: 127

Explanation:​​​​​​​

Block 1: 1
Block 2: 2 * 3 = 6
Block 3: 4 * 5 * 6 = 120
F(3) = 1 + 6 + 120 = 127

Example 2:

Input: n = 7

Output: 6997165

Explanation:

Block 1: 1
Block 2: 2 * 3 = 6
Block 3: 4 * 5 * 6 = 120
Block 4: 7 * 8 * 9 * 10 = 5040
Block 5: 11 * 12 * 13 * 14 * 15 = 360360
Block 6: 16 * 17 * 18 * 19 * 20 * 21 = 39070080
Block 7: 22 * 23 * 24 * 25 * 26 * 27 * 28 = 5967561600
F(7) = 6006997207 % (109 + 7) = 6997165
