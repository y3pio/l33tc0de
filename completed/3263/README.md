# 3263. Convert Doubly Linked List to Array I

You are given the head of a doubly linked list, which contains nodes that have a next pointer and a previous pointer.

Return an integer array which contains the elements of the linked list in order.


```
Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,3,2,1]

Output: [1,2,3,4,3,2,1]

Example 2:

Input: head = [2,2,2,2,2]

Output: [2,2,2,2,2]

Example 3:

Input: head = [3,2,3,2,3,2]

Output: [3,2,3,2,3,2]



Constraints:

The number of nodes in the given list is in the range [1, 50].
1 <= Node.val <= 50
