# 3749. Evaluate Valid Expressions


You are given a string expression that represents a nested mathematical expression in a simplified form.

A valid expression is either an integer literal or follows the format op(a,b), where:

op is one of "add", "sub", "mul", or "div".
a and b are each valid expressions.
The operations are defined as follows:

```
add(a,b) = a + b
sub(a,b) = a - b
mul(a,b) = a * b
div(a,b) = a / b
Return an integer representing the result after fully evaluating the expression.



Example 1:

Input: expression = "add(2,3)"

Output: 5

Explanation:

The operation add(2,3) means 2 + 3 = 5.

Example 2:

Input: expression = "-42"

Output: -42

Explanation:

The expression is a single integer literal, so the result is -42.

Example 3:

Input: expression = "div(mul(4,sub(9,5)),add(1,1))"

Output: 8

Explanation:

First, evaluate the inner expression: sub(9,5) = 9 - 5 = 4
Next, multiply the results: mul(4,4) = 4 * 4 = 16
Then, compute the addition on the right: add(1,1) = 1 + 1 = 2
Finally, divide the two main results: div(16,2) = 16 / 2 = 8
Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 8.



Constraints:

1 <= expression.length <= 105
expression is valid and consists of digits, commas, parentheses, the minus sign '-', and the lowercase strings "add", "sub", "mul", "div".
All intermediate results fit within the range of a long integer.
All divisions result in integer values.
