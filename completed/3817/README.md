# 3817. Good Indices in a Digit String

You are given a string s consisting of digits.

An index i is called good if there exists a substring of s that ends at index i and is equal to the decimal representation of i.

Return an integer array of all good indices in increasing order.


```
Example 1:

Input: s = "0234567890112"

Output: [0,11,12]

Explanation:​​​​​​​

At index 0, the decimal representation of the index is "0". The substring s[0] is "0", which matches, so index 0 is good.

At index 11, the decimal representation is "11". The substring s[10..11] is "11", which matches, so index 11 is good.

At index 12, the decimal representation is "12". The substring s[11..12] is "12", which matches, so index 12 is good.

No other index has a substring ending at it that equals its decimal representation. Therefore, the answer is [0, 11, 12].

Example 2:

Input: s = "01234"

Output: [0,1,2,3,4]

Explanation:

For every index i from 0 to 4, the decimal representation of i is a single digit, and the substring s[i] matches that digit.

Therefore, a valid substring ending at each index exists, making all indices good.

Example 3:

Input: s = "12345"

Output: []

Explanation:

No index has a substring ending at it that matches its decimal representation.

Therefore, there are no good indices and the result is an empty array.



Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s only consists of digits from '0' to '9'.
